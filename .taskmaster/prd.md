- Build trust with transparent data ownership and privacy policies.

## MVP Features
1. **Field Management**: GIS-based mapping, crop rotation, yield tracking, task scheduling.
2. **Inventory Management**: Real-time tracking by crop/variety, quality parameters, storage, buyer portal.
3. **Financial Management**: Purchase/sales order management, P&L by field/crop, cost tracking.
4. **Compliance Reporting**: Water, fertilizer, pesticide tracking, automated regulatory reports.
5. **Labor Management**: Worker scheduling, time tracking, compliance documentation, productivity.
